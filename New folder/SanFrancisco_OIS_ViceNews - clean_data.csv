2/26/2015,1,F,N,L,M,U,Violent altercation,5-Apr,2,,M;M,San Francisco Police Department,"On the evening of February 26, 2015, Amilcar Perez-Lopez (Perez-Lopez) and a second man (Abraham P.) were involved in an altercation which resulted in a knife chase down the 2800 block of Folsom Street. Different accounts have surfaced regarding what led to the knife chase. Abraham P. told investigators that Perez-Lopez wanted to buy his bike and chased him with a knife when he refused to sell it to him. Press accounts reported that Perez-Lopez chased Abraham P. with a knife because Abraham P. had taken his cell phone. (The cell phone was later located by police in Perez-Lopez’s pocket.) A roommate of Perez-Lopez told investigators that Abraham P. had been arguing with Perez-Lopez about whether Perez-Lopez lived at 2843 Folsom Street and had blocked Perez-Lopez from entering the house, when Perez-Lopez walked away but then returned, ran into the house to get a knife, and then ran out of the house and chased Abraham P. down Folsom Street, yelling “Aren’t you macho!” This last account is supported by a MUNI bus video which appears to show Perez-Lopez and Abraham P. standing and facing each other inside the gated area of 2843 Folsom Street, with Abraham P. possibly blocking the entrance to the home. As described in detail in the witness statements below, the knife chase was observed by a neighbor who was out for a jog and by a woman who was waiting for a bus. At 9:44 p.m., the neighbor called 911, described what he had seen, and said he was located at 24th and Folsom Streets, near the bus stop. He described both men as Latin males, five feet, five inches tall, in their thirties, and he gave the address of the house on Folsom Street he believed they may have come out of. The witness described the knife the man was carrying as approximately 12-inches long and shiny, and said both men were running very fast. Based on the 911 call, at 9:45 p.m. SFPD dispatch broadcasted a report of a person with a knife at 24th and Folsom Streets. A marked police unit and a backup unit immediately began a Code 3 response (lights and sirens activated) to the scene. Dispatch further advised officers that the reporting person said that a man was chasing another man with a knife, now running towards 25th Street; that both men were around 5 foot 5 inches tall wearing beanies; and that the men were yelling in Spanish and may have come out of a house on Folsom Street. Additional police units began responding to the scene in Code 3. STATEMENTS OF OFFICERS INVOLVED IN THE SHOOTING Officers Eric Reboli (Star # 1651) and Craig Tiffe (Star # 1312) were in plainclothes and travelling in an unmarked police car near 24th and Harrison Streets when they heard the first broadcast. Officer Reboli was driving and Officer Tiffe was in the front passenger seat. At 9:46 p.m. Officer Tiffe used the computer in their car to electronically place them on the call as a backup responder. Because they were so close to the location, they did not make a Code 3 response. According to Officer Reboli, as they reached the intersection of 25th and Folsom Streets, he saw movement mid-block on the east side of Folsom Street which looked like people running around in the street. He turned the car and proceeded northbound on Folsom Street. Approximately mid-block he saw a male (Abraham P.) standing in the lane of traffic while 2 leaning against a parked car (a blue Nissan), and a second male (Perez-Lopez) standing on the sidewalk, on the opposite side of the parked car. He alerted Officer Tiffe to the presence of the two men, and then parked one to two car lengths behind the blue Nissan. He got out of the driver’s side of the unmarked police car and went to make contact with Abraham P., who was still standing in the lane of traffic. Officer Reboli was wearing his police star clipped to his belt directly in front of his holstered firearm. He announced himself as a police officer and then immediately grabbed Abraham P. by both arms and pinned his arms together in case he was the man with the knife, referenced in the broadcast. Officer Reboli observed that Abraham P. was breathing hard, seemed “almost exhausted,” and was saying something he did not understand. Officer Reboli told Abraham P. they were going to get out of the street and figure out what was going on, and then walked him towards the sidewalk, between the blue Nissan and a silver Toyota parked in front of it. As he was walking Abraham P. in between the two parked cars towards the sidewalk to get him out of the lane of traffic, he glanced over the car at the sidewalk and saw Officer Tiffe speaking to Perez-Lopez, who had his back to Officer Reboli. A few seconds later, Officer Reboli glanced over again and saw Officer Tiffe trying to take Perez-Lopez down to the ground and Perez-Lopez “violently resisting.” Officer Reboli immediately let go of Abraham P. and ran to assist his partner. Once he was five or six feet away from Officer Tiffe and Perez-Lopez, he saw Officer Tiffe lunge backwards and put his hands up with his palms facing outward, “saw a flash of a very large silver knife,” and thought Officer Tiffe may have been stabbed. After he saw Officer Tiffe lunge backwards and saw the flash of the knife, Officer Reboli saw Perez-Lopez turn, face him and start to run in his direction. Officer Reboli stopped, took one or two large steps backwards and reached for his pepper spray and firearm at the same time. He drew his firearm but was unable to get the pepper spray out of his pocket.1 He then shouted either “Police, drop the knife” or “Drop the knife,” at which point Perez-Lopez momentarily stopped, looked at him and then back at Officer Tiffe, and then continued to advance towards Officer Reboli while holding the knife and making slashing motions. Officer Reboli could not recall in which hand Perez-Lopez held the knife, but thought the knife was held with the blade facing out and upward. Officer Reboli said Perez-Lopez was still on the sidewalk, but near the curb, approximately five to six feet away from him. As Perez-Lopez came towards him, he feared he was about to be stabbed. He also feared for the life of his partner, who he thought may have been stabbed, and for the life of Abraham P., who he believed was still in very close proximity. Officer Reboli said he discharged his firearm at Perez-Lopez to stop the threat to his life and to the lives of his partner and Abraham P. Officer Reboli explained that, once he started to discharge his firearm, Perez-Lopez began turning toward the street, then took a step or two before collapsing, face-down between the two parked cars. Officer Reboli saw the knife fall from Perez-Lopez’ grip and watched as it came to rest in the street, above Perez-Lopez’ left shoulder but within his reach. 1 Photos taken of Officer Reboli right after the shooting show what appears to be the top of a pepper spray canister in his right rear pocket, the same side on which his firearm was carried. 3 According to Officer Tiffe, as he and Officer Reboli drove down Folsom Street in response to the 911 dispatch, he initially only saw Abraham P. standing near the driver’s side door the blue Nissan, close to the side-view mirror. As he exited the passenger side of the police car, he saw Perez-Lopez near the side-view mirror on the passenger side of the blue Nissan. At that point, both males were facing each other from opposite sides of the car. Officer Tiffe had his police star displayed on his chest, hanging from a silver chain on the outside of his jacket. He approached Perez-Lopez on the sidewalk from the rear passenger side of the blue Nissan, as Perez-Lopez stood leaning on the car with his body facing towards the street, leaving only his left side visible to Officer Tiffe. As Officer Tiffe reached the rear bumper of the blue Nissan, Perez-Lopez looked over his left shoulder and made eye contact with him. Officer Tiffe said he thought Perez-Lopez appeared to be in some type of altered state and described the look on his face as “bloodlust crazed.” He announced himself as a police officer as he walked towards Perez-Lopez and asked him to step away from the car. He continued walking towards Perez-Lopez, who did not move away from the car as commanded and did not acknowledge him. Officer Tiffe then pointed to the star on his chest, in case Perez-Lopez did not speak English, but he could not tell if Perez-Lopez looked at it or understood he was a police officer since he said nothing and simply appeared to “look through” him. Officer Tiffe believed that Perez-Lopez was either “on something” or too engaged in what he was doing to respond to verbal commands, so he decided to make physical contact with him. As Officer Tiffe got close to Perez-Lopez, he saw Perez-Lopez’s left hand go up, so he grabbed Perez-Lopez’s left arm and his right, back shoulder area, and pulled him away from the car. He then saw Perez-Lopez holding something in his right hand, which was down by his side. Officer Tiffe ordered Perez-Lopez to “Get on the ground!” and spun him around to try to forcibly take him down to the ground. As Officer Tiffe did this, Perez-Lopez suddenly lunged up at him with his right hand. Officer Tiffe disengaged from Perez-Lopez by pushing him about three feet away, and then he saw Perez-Lopez swipe at his chest with the object in his right hand. Once the swipe was completed, Officer Tiffe could see that the object in Perez-Lopez’ right hand was “a very large knife,” which Perez-Lopez was now waving around in the air with the blade pointing up. Officer Tiffe said he knew by this point that Officer Reboli had come to his aid and was on the sidewalk to his right, behind Perez-Lopez. As soon as he saw the knife in Perez-Lopez’s hand, Officer Tiffe drew his firearm and yelled either “Put down the knife” or “Put down the knife or I’ll shoot.” Officer Tiffe said he believed at that moment that Perez-Lopez was going to kill him if given the opportunity, and kill anybody in his way. As Officer Tiffe was shouting commands for Perez-Lopez to drop the knife and focusing on the knife “flailing in the air,” he heard Officer Reboli also yelling something, saw Perez-Lopez take a step in Officer Reboli’s direction with the knife raised, and heard shots. Officer Tiffe recalled that, as the shots were being fired, Perez-Lopez was “kind of moving in different directions,” was at some point “facing, at some point he was turning away,” and appeared to fixate on 4 something in the street, south of where he was standing. He then saw Perez-Lopez take a step between the two parked cars, and raise the knife, either in an outstretched or overhead manner. He didn’t know exactly where Abraham P. was at that point but believed he was very close and thought that Perez-Lopez was going after him, so he fired his weapon one time and saw Perez-Lopez fall to the ground. Officer Tiffe recalled that he next saw Abraham P. “cowering down” on the driver’s side of the blue Nissan, near the driver’s side rear tire, being talked to by Officer Cabillo, who had arrived at the scene moments after the shooting.",San Francisco,knife
